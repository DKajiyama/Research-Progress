# **Background and Objective**

- In recent years, the risk of **social exclusion** has increased due to:
  - Decline of public transportation in rural areas
  - Demographic changes such as population aging

- Prior studies have shown that:
  - Lack of mobility restricts access to activities
  - This may exclude individuals from economic, social, and political life

- People’s physical mobility supports:
  - Face-to-face social interactions
  - Formation and maintenance of **social networks (SN)**

- In particular, weak ties (e.g., acquaintances, familiar strangers):
  - Often emerge from casual or incidental encounters in public spaces
  - Play an important role in social integration and access to information

## **Limitations of existing SN studies in transportation**

- Most empirical studies use **egocentric SN surveys**:
  - Respondents list close contacts using name generators

- **Two major limitations:**
  1. Weak ties are underreported
     - Respondents recall only salient/strong relationships
  2. Network structure cannot be observed
     - Egocentric surveys capture only ego–alter ties
     - Structural characteristics (density, centrality, clustering) are not observable

→
  then:
  - Weak ties and structural features **must be observed**
  - Local egocentric observations are not enough
  - Population- or regional-level inference is required

---

## **Objective of this study**

- To address these challenges, this study proposes the  
  Networked Social Ties and Co-Location (NEST-CL) Survey

- **Key idea:**
  - Observe weak ties and overall SN structures
  - Combine SN survey data with GPS trajectory data
  - Estimate unobserved ties beyond direct observations

- **Ultimate goal:**
  - Build a basis for estimating **tie strength** and **structural characteristics**  
    of social networks at the **population level**
